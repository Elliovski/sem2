                <h2>Consistency vs Adaptability</h2>
                <img src="images/global_marketing.webp" alt="" style="width: 1500px; height: 600px; margin-top:20px">
                <p>Should a global brand be more consistent or more adapted to each region ? 
                    It depends on  the business . Technology brands rarely alter their brand (like iPhone , Samsung ). While food and drinks brands adapts a lot to culture , religion ,and tastes of different regions (Coco-cola , Dominos  ) . It is easier make alterations to food than technology.
                    Out of the two , consistency is more important . Adaptability helps greatly with globalization and bringing diverse range of customers , but without consistency there is no global brand.
                    Most global businesses need to balance the two to their needs.</p>
                    <h2 style="color: green;">Consistency vs Adaptability for FreshMart</h2>
                    <p>FreshMart is a supermarket. So it is easy to be adaptable without affecting the consistency off brand. You can change the marketing  and the items being sold for each region .</p>

                <img src="images/global-brand-recognition.webp" alt="" style="width: 1500px; height: 600px; margin-top:20px">
                <p>Why global  branding has its hardships related to it being global:</p>
                <p>
                    Cultural Differences: What works in one country may not resonate in another.
                    Legal and Regulatory Barriers: Different countries have different laws affecting branding and marketing.
                    Competition from Local Brands: Global brands must compete with well-established local brands.
                    There is also the issue of language barriers and economic and pricing differences.
                    </p>
