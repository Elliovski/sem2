                <h2>Consistency vs Adaptability</h2>
                <p>Should a global brand be more consistent or more adapted to each region ?                 </p>
                <p>It depends on  the business . Technology brands rarely alter their brand (like iPhone , Samsung ). While food and drinks brands adapts a lot to culture , religion ,and tastes of different regions (Coco-cola , Dominos  ) . It is easier make alterations to food than technology.                </p>
                <p>Out of the two , consistency is more important . Adaptability helps greatly with globalization and bringing diverse range of customers , but without consistency there is no global brand.                </p>
                <p>Most global businesses need to balance the two.</p>
